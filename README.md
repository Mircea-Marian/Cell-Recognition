# Cell-Recognition

The main purpose of the program is to recognize the pixels that are/are not inside a biological cell. Than it centers the cell on 4 criteria: geometrical center, mass center, red center(pixels that have R=127, G=0, B=0) and a weighter arithmetic mean center(the weights are stored in a different file besides the .tif file of the image).
